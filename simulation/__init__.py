Meguri Phase 0 Simulation Engine

Integrated simulation of 7 mechanisms:
1. Decay mechanism (κ, θ, g(S))
2. Proof of Being (2-layer: binary flag F(v) + continuous score S(v))
3. Mana distribution (75% deterministic + 25% Bloom events)
4. VRF randomness (cryptographically fair)
5. Device binding (structural Sybil cost)
6. Grace Period (long-absence recovery path)
7. Community normalization (monthly Louvain clustering)
